# water-purifier-app
This is an app that I created on Android Studio for Bach Khoa Innovation 2023


## Functions
- Login and register using Firebase Realtime Database.
- Edit profile and personal info.
- Calculate ideal daily water consumption by collecting personal info.
- Show water quality as graphs of TDS levels.
- Show water pH graph.
- Show daily water consumption with the last 7 days.
- Some UI elements.

## Note
  This is still a working in progress, the app is built only to work partially at basic functions so there are many elements of the app that I do not have time
  to work on and because the project is finished so I will continue working on other projects.
  You can use the code as reference if you are going to build a similar app. Note that it is still spagetti code, so you will have to dig and fix some leftover bugs
  in the code.
